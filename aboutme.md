title: About me
---

Since October 2015, I have been a lecturer/senior lecturer/associate professor in the Schools of Earth, Atmospheric, and Life Sciences (formerly School of Earth & Environmental Sciences) at the University of Wollongong in **Wollongong, Australia**. From October 2012-2015, I was a postdoc in the School of Chemistry at UOW. I grew up in **Humboldt County, California**, a beautiful rural area of northern California in heart of the redwoods. After high school, I spent a year as a Rotary exchange student in **Grenoble, France**, a beautiful town in the middle of the French Alps. I returned to the U.S. to attend Caltech (the California Institute of Technology) in **Pasadena, California**, where I obtained a degree in planetary science. I next found myself in **London, England**, first as an exchange student and then again for six months after graduation. After a brief stint in **Washington, D.C.** exploring the world of science policy, I headed to **Cambridge, Massachusetts** to complete my PhD in atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University.

I now live in the beautiful beachside suburb of **North Wollongong** (80 km south of Sydney) with my husband Dr Richard Cook, who works at the University of Wollongong in the Research Services Office. Outside of work, we are most likely to be found training for triathlons, scuba diving, hiking, exploring Australia, and discovering new places.
