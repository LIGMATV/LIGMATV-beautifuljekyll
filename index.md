### Research Overview
My research centres on investigating the sources, chemical evolution, and transport pathways of atmospheric pollution. I use a global chemical transport model combined with observational data sets (ground-based, aircraft, and satellite) to increase our fundamental understanding of the impacts of human activity and natural processes on atmospheric composition in diverse environments.

### News

- I presented a research plenary on "Sustainable Planet" for the Unviversity Global Partnership Network (UGPN) 2021 virtual conference.
- Stephen Macfarlane and James Portwin joined us as new Honours students. Stephen is working on mercury emissions in Australia and James is working on radonic storms in the Souther Ocean (jointly with ANSTO).
- Our review of [Atmospheric mercury in Australia: Recent findings and future research needs](https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2020.070) was published in a special forum of *Elementa* on [Mercury in the Southern Hemisphere and Tropics](https://collections.elementascience.org/mercury-in-the-southern-hemisphere-and-tropics). We also published a related piece in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/australias-gold-industry-stamped-out-mercury-pollution-now-its-coals-turn-151202).
- I am excited to have accepted a new (part-time) position as the Associate Dean Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the UOW Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health!
