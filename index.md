### Associate Professor
#### [Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry](https://www.uow.edu.au/science-medicine-health/research/centre-for-atmospheric-chemistry/)<br />
#### [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/)

Room G19, Building 41, Northfields Avenue  
Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia  
P: +61 2 4221 5484

### Research Overview
My research centres on investigating the sources, chemical evolution, and transport pathways of atmospheric pollution. I use a global chemical transport model combined with observational data sets (ground-based, aircraft, and satellite) to increase our fundamental understanding of the impacts of human activity and natural processes on atmospheric composition in diverse environments.

### Teaching Overview
I teach earth systems science and introductory programming to undergraduate students. For more details, including my teaching philosophy, please see my [teaching portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/jfisher-teaching-portfolio/home). To access the Jupyter notebooks I use for teaching Python, please see my [teaching Github page](https://jennyfisher.github.io/computing-modelling-earthsci/).
