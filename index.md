### Research Overview
My research centres on investigating the sources, chemical evolution, and transport pathways of atmospheric pollution. I use a global chemical transport model combined with observational data sets (ground-based, aircraft, and satellite) to increase our fundamental understanding of the impacts of human activity and natural processes on atmospheric composition in diverse environments.

### Teaching Overview
I teach earth systems science and introductory programming to undergraduate students. For more details, including my teaching philosophy, please see my [teaching portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/jfisher-teaching-portfolio/home). To access the Jupyter notebooks I use for teaching Python, please see my [teaching Github page](https://jennyfisher.github.io/computing-modelling-earthsci/).

### News

- A [new paper](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/EM/D2EM00019A) led by PhD student (and former Honours student) Stephen MacFarlane was published in *Environmental Sciences: Processes and Impacts*. The paper describes how Australian anthropogenic mercury emissions have changed over the past 20 years, and what this means for atmospheric mercury and mercury deposition. Congratulations, Stephen!
- PhD student Dominique Kpokro arrived in Wollongong! Dom is undertaking an interdisciplinary joint PhD at UOW (with the [Centre for Atmospheric Chemistry](https://www.uow.edu.au/science-medicine-health/research/centre-for-atmospheric-chemistry/)) and the Unversity of Surrey (with Professor [Gavin Hilson](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/gavin-hilson)), working on understanding the environmental and social implications of artisanal and small-scaled gold mining in West Africa. Welcome Dom!
- I was awarded the [2022 Anton Hales Medal](https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/awards-and-opportunities/honorific-awardees/2022-awardees#hales) from the Australian Academy of Sciences.
- Stephen Macfarlane began his PhD. Stephen will be working on a project with collaborators at Caltech, NOAA, and the US EPA to improve understanding of the atmospheric chemistry and impacts of aromatic pollutants.
